## 🎮 How To Play

The Goal: Rearrange the scrambled tiles to reform the original image.

1.  **The Golden Rule:** The empty black square **must** end up in the bottom-right corner to trigger the win state.
2.  **Move It:** Click adjacent tiles, drag them towards the empty spot, or use your Arrow Keys.
3.  **Need a Hint?** Look at the "TARGET" preview in the sidebar to remember what you're building.
4.  **Change It Up:** Hit the "Gallery" or "Upload" buttons to swap the cartridge and play a new image.
